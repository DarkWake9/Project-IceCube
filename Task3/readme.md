# TASK 3: Assigned 26062022

    Redo both sets of experiments (Task 1 and Task 2) after splitting the data energy wise (0.3-1 TeV, 1-3 TeV, 3-10 TeV)
    After that for method 2 (when counting no of matches within the neutrino error circle) instead of counting the background events by looking at the no of neutrino-MSP pairs within the same cos(error region) offset by 5 degrees,
    Follow the same method as in        https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11375v1.pdf      which is briefly summarized below
        1. Generate a synthetic catalog of MSPs uniformly distributed in the same RA and DEC range as observed population
        2, Count no of coincidences  within neutrino error circle for the synthetic catalog in (1). 
        3. Repeat step (1) and (2) 100 times and take the average.
